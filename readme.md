Hi Professor, myself Surya Narayanan Murugaiyan Ragupathy from Tamil Nadu, India. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering in India (2019). Even after completing my under-graduation, my thirst to gain in-depth knowledge of computer science remains unquenched. Hence, I had worked and gained experience in EMIS Health Care as a Software Associate in an Extracts Project. I did my final year project GPS-based bus route tracking system using the language Core Java during my undergrad. I did my mini-project "Beat in a Teeth" which bought me many accolades including Dr.Kalam Young Achiever Award presented by World youth Foundation (WYF) during my bachelor's.

# Course Objective

Immediately, upon completing this course, "Advanced Web Server Program", I aspire to become an expert in full-stack development that will help me to achieve a software developer role in a reputed company. In the long time run, I wish to be an entrepreneur starting my own web development company that develops websites and e-products and contributes to society in their daily chores.
